CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
With the help of CSS we can show the designing part of our content as well as we can make our webpage more attractive.

3. What is JavaScript?
Javascript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, 
animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a 
few lines of JavaScript code.)

4. Why JavaScript come into picture.
In old days websites are mainly built with the help of only html and css so we can give only structure and designing part to
a website but we not able to give a functionality to a webpage.
for eg.if we want to show an event of button when someone clicks on it .we not able to gie this functionality with the help 
of Html and CSS so for this purpose JavaScript came into picture.
